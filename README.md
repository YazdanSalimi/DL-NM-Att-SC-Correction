# DL-NM-Att-SC-Correction
## This repository offers versatile deep learning based attenuation and scatter correction solution in nuclear medicine modalities including PET and SPECT.
diferent tracers are convered here. 
the inference instruction is presented at [example.py](https://github.com/YazdanSalimi/DL-NM-Att-SC-Correction/example.py) , you need to download the trained model for each task and convert your emission images to NIFTI before running the models.) soon. The PET images should be in weight based SUV unit. the instruction for converting Dicom to NIFTI and SUV PET conversion will be updated [here](https://github.com/YazdanSalimi/medical-image-processing-tools).
